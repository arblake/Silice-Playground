# Silice-Playground
My Silice (https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice) Coding Experimental Area

Examples to play with FOMU, DE10NANO with MiSTer SDRAM, USB HUB and I/O BOARD, ULX3S (awaiting!) via Silice.

Attempting to port the j1eforth from FOMU to DE10NANO, whilst the design compiles, and runs, there is an issue with the TX on the UART as approximately every other character is missing. It can read input from the UART and action the commands.

Progress!
